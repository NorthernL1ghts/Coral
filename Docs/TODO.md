# Coral TODO

- Maybe make a MathF class or something to handle the case where Math.abs is called because it's used internally within the tests so maybe instead of having to reference the function instead make a class to handle that case? I don't think this would make the performance much better, it at all; but it's something to think about because I am noticing the repetition,
